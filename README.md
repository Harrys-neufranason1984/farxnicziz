Oh man, just tumbled out of that theater like I was chipping away layers of sediment for hours (back’s still protesting like granite s cemented to my chair). Bring Her Back's a whirlwind! The echoes of the surround sound are still dancing around my noggin. The scene where she, like.. comes back with the sandstorm in the desert, felt like I was peering straight into the core of the Earth, all that dust and chaos swirling like my popcorn crumbs under the seats.

The whole theater was a cacophony. People rustling, and whispers like tectonic movements. I think there was someone snoring behind me — like a drill boring a hole for core samples, but somehow comforting? And the clay-like layers of suspense, my fingernails were practically scraping at the scenes, bit by bit, reaching for the climax to crystallize.

> I mean, when she was running across the molten landscape, felt like an avalanche just unleashed on my senses. The script melted down a few times, though, like bad igneous rock that couldn’t quite hold form. Still, got those volcanic eruptions of emotion when she saw the lighthouse... or was it a tower? Images mixed up like sedimentary layers when you’re half asleep, scraping through visual bedrock.

Remembered Dave asked if he should download the movie or watch the movie. Never been more torn; half-think it’s best experienced with a crowd, where whispers and gasps layer like stratified soils. But alone, with just the wind... confounding, like puzzling out a paleolithic site at dusk.

What was up with the clunky dialogues around mid-section? Choppy, like a seismograph that's drunk, but then somehow they stitched together a narrative web by the end. When she finally confronts... uh, whoever that was, it was like a climactic landslide, things piling up relentlessly. My brain's a bit of a rockfall right now, still sorting jagged scenes from soft dialogues.

Ah, those credits rolled with a soundtrack that lingered, reverberating like the last tremor after a quake. Can’t stop humming... or wait, that could be my phone buzzing. Probably need a nap. Or coffee. Or both.
